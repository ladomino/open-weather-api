## Setting up

#### Make sure you follow all of these steps!

For this assignment you'll be using the Open Weather Data API. In order to use it, please follow these steps:

1. Fork and clone this repo.
2. Sign up for a free [Open Weather Map](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up) account!
3. Once you've signed up, you're given an [API key](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys). Copy that API key and keep track of it somewhere!
(Your .env is a good place)
4. Test the url in browser to verify that your key works. 

```
api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?zip={ZIP CODE},us&units=imperial&appid={API KEY}
```

5. Once you know your key works, get an Express server running.
    - `cd` into your cloned directory
    - `npm init` or `npm init -y` for a faster start up
    - `touch` and `mkdir` the files and directories you need for a Liquid-Express app. Make sure to include a .env and .gitignore. 
    You won't need a `models` directory or any of the Mongo connection code for this deliverable.
    - Install your dependencies: express, liquid-express-views, dotenv
    - In your `server.js` make sure to include your dependencies and get the server listening (ports 3000 and 8000 are used frequently)
    - Connect your routes to `server.js` (Be mindful of exporting and your file paths)


## Your view(s) should have:
- An input field for a user to enter a zip code
- A submit button
- When the submit button is clicked:
    - A GET request should hit a route that fetches and returns the weather data from the API
    - The following data should be rendered on the page:
        - City name
        - Current temperature
        - Weather description
        - Min temp
        - Max temp
- Have the temperature turn blue if under 40, and red if above 90.

Here are some zip codes to test!
- 99501 (Anchorage)
- 99723 (Barrow, AK)
- 60605 (Chicago)
- 70124 (New Orleans)
- 77030 (Houston, TX)
- 00902 (San Juan, Puerto Rico)
- 46923 (Delphi, IN)
- 94123 (San Francisco, CA)

**Bonus**
- Make it pretty with some more CSS! 
- Add a five day forecast with their [5 day forecast endpoint](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5)
- Include the sunrise and sunset times (hint: maybe [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) will be helpful!) and some information about humidity, atmospheric pressure, etc.
- Use CSS Animation, images, etc. (think weather app)
- Leverage Bootstrap to build a mobile version
